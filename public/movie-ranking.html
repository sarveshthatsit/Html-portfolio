<HR>
    <h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
    <p>Best scientific biopic, A cult classic cinema.</p>
    <h3>A silent voice</h3>
    <p>This is truly an incredible film.  I'm not one to cry while watching movies, but I've seen A Silent Voice three times now and get emotional every time.</p>
    <h3>Holidate</h3>
    <p>I don't know why this movie was hated by so many people but I loved this film, it really shows that whenever you think there is no hope at all, there is somewhere! I loved the bond between Sloane and Jackson</p>
