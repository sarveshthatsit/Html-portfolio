<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Sarvesh Ravindra Goyal from Mumbai.</p>

<p>This is my first portfolio page ever, I have been learning web development on Udemy from Dr. Angela Yu </p>

<p>Currently Im pursuing my degree in Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA) from Thakur polytechnic. Well you must be thinking that Why am I doing a online course about the things which I'll be anyways learning in my degree, the reason is the way the education system works. All the colleges provide 90% of the things theoretically but in real life the value of practical knowledge is much more than theory, so I thought doing an online course will help me build my practical knowledge and I get an internship or a part time job with the help of it and improve my CV and maybe get a high paid salary job in future.</p>
<p>So far I have learnt about HTML and with the help of that I am creating this website.</p>
<p>THANK YOU!!</p>
